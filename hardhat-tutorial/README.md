# WHITELIST-DAPP

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.
First, you need to create a Whitelist-Dapp folder where the Hardhat project and your Next.js app will later go. Open up a terminal and execute these commands
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
mkdir Whitelist-Dapp
cd Whitelist-Dapp
```

Then, in Whitelist-Dapp folder, we will set up a Hardhat project

```
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

```
npx hardhat
```

Make sure you select Create a Javascript Project and then follow the steps in the terminal to complete your Hardhat setup
